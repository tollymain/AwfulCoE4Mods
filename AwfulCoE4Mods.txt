Changelog: 
v.1 Initial release
v.1.01 Added recruitable watered-down militia for generic captains
v.1.02 
- Unified unit names
- Slightly beefed up the guardians to the point where they can take a group of giant mantises (somewhat common early gameover) and survive
- Wild animals will now try to stay in their home terrain (forests, desert, no more lions in the arctic, etc.)
v.1.03
- Fixed a few small bugs
- Guardian Commanders now have easier-to-recognise names
- Added pre-battle companion summons from homeland security
- Bandits and such will try to stay in settlements
v.1.04
- Added Engineers, they turn into Chief Engineers and Chief Capitalist after some time
- Engineers are somewhat rare and expensive (class dependant) but produce a tiny amount of static income (~60 turns before it pays back)
- Engineers can cut down forests/jungles, Chief Engineers can deal with mountains
- Building things is cheaper higher level engineers and they have other benefits too
- Stagecoach plans put on hold for now because I'd need to get a good unit icon for them (has to be done through structure "units" I'm afraid)
- Maybe some other changes that I can't remember

- Engineers now make Dead Forests instead of Plains when cutting down forested terrain.
- Added slightly better descriptions to the new units
- Reduced recruitment chance for Engineers

- Hopefully fixed paths to work on linux
v.1.08

This gives class-themed starting immobile units and commanders to everyone. They are not selectable for movement/transfer nor recruitable, making it easy not to confuse them with the real units. Sentry the defensive commander, he can't move or use rituals anyway. Same purpose as most similar mods, also has the effect that you have to both conquer the starting AI citadel [i]and[/i] kill all the commanders to win. Has several benefits including letting you contain enemies so you can play with the rest of the game or even farm them for charmed commanders, and making it even less likely that the AI gets killed by a pack of stray moose. Post any comments, suggestions, etc, here. Credit where it's due to the original authors of mods like these but honestly it's modding so whatever.

I've done the watered-down militia thing - the generic captains can now use two new rituals, one that adds 1d3 super crappy militia (like even worse than normal) to a settlement site at the cost of 1AP, and another one which adds tiny less crappy militia (actually a watered down version of the Baron militia in this case) for 1AP and 2 iron.
